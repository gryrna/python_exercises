In the 16th century,
an age of great marine
and terrestrial exploration,
Ferdinand Magellan led the
first expedition to sail around
the world. 
As a young Portuguese noble,
he served
the king of Portugal,
but he became involved in the
quagmire of political intrigue
at court and lost the king’s favor.
After
he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal,
he offered to serve
the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.
A papal decree of 1493
had assigned all land in the New World
west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain
and all the land east of that line to Portugal.
Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies
fell under Spanish authority.
On September 20, 1519,
Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships.
More than a year later,
one of these ships was exploring the topography
of South America in search
of a water route across the continent.
This ship sank,
but the remaining four ships searched
along the southern peninsula of South America.
Finally they found the
passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude.
Magellan named this passage
the Strait of All Saints,
but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.
One ship deserted while in this
passage and returned to Spain,
so fewer sailors were privileged to
gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean.
Those who remained crossed the
meridian now known as the International Date Line
in the early spring of 1521
after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean.
During those long days at sea,
many of Magellan’s men died of
starvation and disease.
Later,
Magellan became involved in an insular
conflict in the Philippines
and was killed in a tribal battle.
Only one ship and 17 sailors
under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano
survived to complete the westward journey to Spain
and thus prove once and for all that the world is round,
with no precipice
at the edge.
